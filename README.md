# jh-fotos
Jannis Hinkelmann's Photos Homepage with Landing Page, Portfolio and Contact.

Used Technologies:
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- Bootstrap 3 CSS library (http://getbootstrap.com)
- "Greyscale" Stat Bootstrap theme (http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/)
- "Creative" Start Bootstrap theme (http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/creative/)
- Sass CSS preprocessor (http://sass-lang.com)
- jQuery JavaScript library (http://jquery.com)
- TypeScript JavaScript preprocessor (https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- [AngularJS Framework (http://angularjs.org)] (probably too much overhead for this small project)

External libraries like bootstrap and jQuery may be included via CDN for development. For production all librarys are hostet on the webserver.

The Repository may not include processed files like css and js. Just include SASS files and AngularJS files.
